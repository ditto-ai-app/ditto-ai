### Voice Recognition API

Before the creation of this prototype, a research on existing speech-to-text APIs was conducted to find a candidate best suited for the purposes of this project. Among them was the [Google Cloud Speech-To-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text?hl=en) API was selected based on a combination of low costs, low, latency, and more importantly, high accuracy with word-level confidence, which some services don't offer.
