# Pimslr AI

## Onboarding Prototype

This version of the application is a prototype for the **onboarding process** of the application. The onboarding process has a significant role in the application. Unlike other apps, PimslrAI does not come with content when installed on a user's device. All the content is generated using user inputs. FOr that reason, the onboarding process cannot be static images with dewscriptive text only. Data has not extracted for the user, including the language the user wishes to learning, his desired level, and his interests. Once this information is extracted, a course is immediately generated and made available to the user.

### Version 1

This first iteration of the onboarding process involved only text inputs which is not very engaging for the user. After the user selects his desired language, he has to manually enter his level of understanding; assessing one's level in a language is not necessarily obvious to write down. Afterwards, the user must input their interests which some users may not care much about.

### Version 2

The second iteration of the prototype replaces the final page where users had to manually enter their interests into a list of selectable tags instead:

</div>

### Version 3

The thrid iteration of the prototype replaces the second page where users had to manually enter their level of understanding into a dropdown of pre existing presets: begining, intermediate, and advanced, alongside a short description of the level of complexity of the sentences:

</div>

### Version 4

The final version of the prototype reinstates the possibility for users to manually enter their interests in freeform text for users that wish most granularity in the topic:

</div>

This final version of the prototype was successfully implemented in the final version of the application. 

### Improvements

One improvement that was not implemented is real-time pronunciation assessment. Rather than letting users decide what their language level they are at, users could instead utter pre-generated sentences for the selected language and let the scoring decide the complexity level.
