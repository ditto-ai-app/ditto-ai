## About

PimslrAI is a university project whose aim is to combine both software and UX/UI research. The app was developed on React Native and is paired with an ASP.NET backend. More information regarding the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/pimslr-ai/language-service).

The app was made available for download on the iOS AppStore and Android through side loading. 

> ⚠️ If you are reading this after January 2023, the app may no longer be in working condition.

Below is a demo that showcases the current state of the app.
